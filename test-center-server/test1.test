# each line represents a command to send to your app.
# here's some examples

# each command will in turn be reflected and executed on the device/app
# each command must return a true/false or throw an exception
# true = the statement was successful, keep going
# false = something failed was or incorrect

# there's a few build in commands

# it also sends a message to the other devices
exec dev[0] method1

# method1Response, waits for the message from dev[0] and triggers some action
